	<h4>My name is Michelle Gallego.</h4>
	<ul><i>(prononced mi-shell gah-jeh-go)</i></ul>
	<ol>
	<li>I grew up in Watertown, Massachusetts. This is a city about 15 minutes outside of Boston.</li>
		<li>My major in the graduate program is Digital Media Design.</li>
		<li>My only previous web dev experience is a couple of classes here at HES: CSCI 12: "Website Development", and DGMD 1: "From Ideas to Designs.""</li>
		<li>I do not have any software development experience.</li>
		<li>I'm excited to take this course because I'd like to improve my proficiency in coding and create seamless experiences. Also, I am working toward completing the prerequisites for the ALM in Digital Media Design and this course seems like the most engaging/applicable for me to take in the Web Design and Development bucket.</li></ol>

		<p>I visit Colombia every year to see family and friends, but it's more rare that we go to the coast.</p>
		<p>This is Minca. It's surreal - in the clouds surrounded by lush forests and beautiful flowers.</p>
